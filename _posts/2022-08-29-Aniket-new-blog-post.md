## Being a Data Scientist

A Venn diagram created by Hugh Conway in 2010, defines a data scientist as a person who has high knowlegde in 3 domains namely: maths and statistics, hacking skills and having knowledge about a specific domain or subject.
Being a data scientist is all about gathering and processing large amounts of data to extract useful data which can then be used for applying machine learning algorithms and predictive analysis. 
Also, a data scientist understands the business point of view of an organization and can help in predictions and trends which helps the company make important product related decisions.

## Skills Required by Data Scientist

A data scientist should have in his arsenal, strong programming knowledge of python or R language along with SQL database coding and strong analytical and mathematical skills. Also, strong knowledge of advanced statistical models and computing tools like Hadoop, Hive, Spark is also required.

##Data Scientists vs Statisticians

Brad Schumitsch, an employee of Twich and a PhD in machine learning from Stanford believes that statistics is a crucial component of data science. However, there are various differences between a data scientist and statistician. One of the major difference is dealing with data. Data scientists deal with huge amount of data which takes a lot of time for cleansing and extracting useful data for further analysis, whereas statisticians rely on traditional data collection methods like surveys,polls, etc. 
Data science is more focused on predictive analysis for which various machine learning models are trained based on the data and the one with the best predictive accuracy is selected for prediction, whereas statisticians use simple regression techniques to check if the data follows model assumptions like linearity assumption, etc. The best model is created by taking care of the assumptions that are violated by using different techniques. 

## Where do I stand ? A Data Scientist or Statistician ?

In my opinion, I am more inclined towards the skills that a data scientist has in his arsenal. Having knowledge about programming languages like python and R along with SQL helps me deal with large amount of data in real life. However, having worked on project during my masters that consist of training regression models also proves to be helpful even while dealing with data science problems which stresses the fact that both statistics and data science fields are coinciding.
