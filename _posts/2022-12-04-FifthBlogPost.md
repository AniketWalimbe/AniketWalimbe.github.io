# Summarizing the Course 
## Important Takeaways from the course 

This course increased my interest in the field of Data Science. In my previous coursework, I studied regression analysis more in detail, whereas this course
also stressed on the importance of EDA and statistical summaries which are also an integral part of data analysis process. Also, this course improved my programming
skills in R which is a plus point for me since R is a better language for a statistical analysis. In the future, before creating any regression or tree models,
I will definitely carry out EDA first and also use variable selection methods to simply the process and reach a better solution. Also, I would definitely not shy 
away from working on complex datasets now that I know how to actually deal with the data. Shiny app was a completely new concept for me, so it has definitely improved my 
knowledge and also increased my curiosity in the field of data science even more.
 
## Future Career Aspiration 

Data Science is a huge field, but I would definitely like to work as a Data Scientist in the future. I would want to add SAS programming to my skillset which would help me 
know more about the field. I am also looking to learn more about machine learning models and also know more about variable selection techniques since it is one of the main 
part before creating any models.
