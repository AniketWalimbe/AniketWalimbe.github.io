# ST 558 Project 1 Summary 
## Purpose
One of the main purpose of the project was to deal with data and to rearrange and plot the data for data visualization process as well as getting familiar with developing functions to work with data.
Seperating a single dataset into county and non county data was a bit of a task but it helps to represent the data in a better format so that only the data required to solve a specific issue can be obtained.
## Learning 
We understood indexing, re arranging and working with data with and without the use of functions and how functions are a better way to work on large datasets. Combining 2 datasets and then working on it to plot the enrollment values based on years gave a clear idea of the trend of enrollment each year. This visualization can help to work on various issues such as enrollment predictions and any other choosen issues.
