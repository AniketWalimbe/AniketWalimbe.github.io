# Exploratory Data Analysis : The First Step 

## What is EDA ?
EDA was originally developed by American mathematician John Turkey in the 1970s and is used by Data Scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. 

## Strategy for EDA 
Before starting with EDA the first thing I do is go through the dataset and see the column names and get an overview of the data I am working with. Based on the actual goal of a project, and the amount of data we have, EDA can be carried out in different ways.
One way of starting with EDA is to check the amount of missing data we have and then, based on the purpose, if there is a lot of missing data in a column, we can remove that column if it doesn.t suit the purpose. 
The next step would be to clssify the features to check if they are either categorical, discrete or continuous variables. This is an important step since this classification gives us an idea of what statistical methods should be used and also what plots can help us for visualization purposes. 
Some of the typical graphical techniques used in EDA are :
* Box plots
* Scatter Plots
* Histogram
* Bar charts
* Pareto chart 
The next step would then be to plot the data to find out various things like collinearity between two variables, to maximize insight into a dataset, detect outliers and anamolies, testing underlying assumptions and many more things.  

## Objectives of EDA 
One of the main goals of EDA is to look at the data before making any assumptions about it. It helps to identify the outliers present in the data and also gives us an idea about the relationship between various features(columns) present in the data. These insights can then be used to fulfill the purpose of the project which can either be prediction or any other company requirement.
